	<p><h3>The world is ever-changing.
		It has come so far in the past century in terms of resourcefulness.<br>
		With this modern age, great urbanization has lead people to cities deemed perfect to live in.<br>
		But there are obviously many factors to make a city viable to live in besides job opportunities
		and generalized idea of "city life".<br>
		What specific reasons make these 10 cities the most "liveable" cities in the world - desired by many people who come to them?<br><br>

		<u>Cities mentioned</u> are based on aggregation in the The Economist Intelligence Unitâ€™s 2019 Global Liveability Index.<br>
