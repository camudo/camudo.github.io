From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.<br>The Aurora Borealis, more commonly reffered to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted bt the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous greek streaks across the skies.</div></div><br>
  <i><div class="block2"><div class="text2">Ice climbing and hiking on glaciers</i><BR><br>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake--namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practices year-round and takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).</div></div><img src="images/iceland1.jpg" class="image2"></div>
